# Docker Swarm

**Introduction:**

Docker Swarm is a powerful clustering and orchestration tool that allows you to manage and scale Docker containers across multiple nodes. In this guide, we will cover the basics of Docker Swarm, including setting up a Swarm, joining nodes, deploying services, scaling, updating, and more. Whether youâ€™re new to Docker or looking to expand your container orchestration skills, this article will provide you with a solid foundation to get started with Docker Swarm.


**Prerequisites:**

Before we dive into Docker Swarm, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Docker concepts and commands.
- Three machines (virtual or physical): one as the manager node and two as worker nodes. These machines should have Docker installed.

**Setting Up Docker Swarm:**

1. Initialize the Swarm on the manager node:

```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER_NODE_IP>
```

To check token
docker swarm join-token manager

</aside>

2. Join the worker nodes to the Swarm:

On each worker node, run the following command (replaceÂ `<MANAGER_NODE_IP>`Â with the IP address of the manager node):

```
docker swarm join - token <TOKEN> <MANAGER_NODE_IP>:2377
```

3. Verify the Swarm status:

On the manager node, run:

```
docker node ls
```

**Deploying and Managing Services in Docker Swarm:**

Deploying a service:

```
docker service create - name my-nginx - replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx
```

Listing services:

```
docker service ls
```

Scaling a service:

```
docker service scale my-nginx=5
```

Updating a service:

```
docker service update - image nginx:latest my-nginx
```

Inspecting a service:

```
docker service inspect my-nginx
```

Removing a service:

```
docker service rm my-nginx
```

**Conclusion:**

Docker Swarm provides a simple yet powerful solution for orchestrating containers in a distributed environment. With the ability to deploy, scale, update, and manage services across multiple nodes, Docker Swarm empowers developers and system administrators to build resilient and scalable applications.

Remember to experiment and explore additional features such as service rolling updates, service rollback, service constraints, and more. Happy container orchestration with Docker Swarm!
